# Learning Resources

A collection of notes, summaries, and reference materials from various learning sources including research papers, blog posts, documentation, videos, and other educational content.

## Directory Structure

### `2025/`
Monthly reading summaries and notes organized chronologically:
- Technical papers and research publications
- Industry blog posts and articles  
- Documentation deep-dives
- Video lecture notes
- Tutorial summaries

### `topics/`
Content organized by subject area:
- **gpu_programming/**: CUDA, Metal, compute shaders
- **machine_learning/**: ML systems, optimization, training
- **systems_programming/**: Performance, memory management, concurrency
- **algorithms/**: Data structures, parallel algorithms
- **hardware/**: GPU architecture, memory hierarchies

### `references/`
Quick reference materials and cheat sheets:
- API references and command lists
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Best practices and common patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
- Tool configuration references

## Content Types

This directory includes notes from:
- **Research Papers**: Academic publications and preprints
- **Blog Posts**: Industry insights and technical articles
- **Documentation**: Official guides and references
- **Videos**: Conference talks, tutorials, courses
- **Books**: Technical books and reference materials
- **Forums**: Stack Overflow, Reddit, discussion threads

## Organization Guidelines

### Monthly Summaries (2025/)
- One file per month (e.g., `January.md`, `February.md`)
- Include source links and key takeaways
- Note practical applications and implementation ideas
- Track learning progress and insights

### Topic-Based Notes (topics/)
- Group related content regardless of source type
- Include implementation examples where relevant
- Cross-reference with kernel implementations in `/kernels/`
- Note performance implications and trade-offs

### Reference Materials (references/)
- Keep concise and scannable
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Update regularly as tools and APIs evolve
- Include examples and common use cases

## Learning Workflow

1. **Capture**: Take notes while reading/watching
2. **Summarize**: Extract key insights and actionable items
3. **Connect**: Link to existing knowledge and implementations
4. **Apply**: Implement concepts in kernels or projects
5. **Reference**: Create quick-access materials for future use

This structure supports continuous learning across multiple formats and sources while maintaining easy access to accumulated knowledge.
