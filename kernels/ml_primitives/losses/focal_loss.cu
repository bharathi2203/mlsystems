/*
 * Focal Loss Function
 * 
 * Advanced loss function for addressing class imbalance in classification tasks.
 * Focuses learning on hard examples by down-weighting easy examples.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - Hard example mining
 * - Class imbalance handling
 * - Modulating factor for easy examples
 * - Alpha weighting for different classes
 * 
 * Formula:
 * FL(p_t) = -α_t * (1 - p_t)^γ * log(p_t)
 * where:
 * - p_t = predicted probability for true class
 * - α_t = class-specific weighting factor
 * - γ = focusing parameter (typically 2)
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Addresses class imbalance without resampling
 * - Focuses on hard-to-classify examples
 * - Reduces loss contribution from easy examples
 * - Improves performance on minority classes
 * 
 * Applications:
 * - Object detection (RetinaNet)
 * - Medical diagnosis (rare disease detection)
 * - Text classification with imbalanced labels
 * - Any classification task with class imbalance
 * 
 * Performance target: ~220μs forward + 250μs backward on RTX 4090
