/*
 * Mish Activation Function
 * 
 * Self-regularizing activation function that often outperforms ReLU and Swish.
 * Smooth, non-monotonic activation with better gradient flow.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - Self-regularizing properties
 * - Smooth everywhere (continuously differentiable)
 * - Non-monotonic behavior helps with feature learning
 * - Better accuracy than ReLU in many cases
 * 
 * Formula: Mish(x) = x * tanh(softplus(x)) = x * tanh(ln(1 + e^x))
 * 
 * Properties:
 * - Range: approximately [-0.31, âˆž)
 * - Smooth and differentiable everywhere
 * - Unbounded above, bounded below
 * 
 * Performance target: ~3.9 GFLOPS on RTX 4090
