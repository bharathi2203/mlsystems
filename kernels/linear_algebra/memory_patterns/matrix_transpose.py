Triton Matrix Transpose Kernel

Efficient matrix transposition with memory optimization
Critical for many linear algebra operations

Triton-specific optimizations:
- Block-level tiling for memory efficiency
- Automatic vectorization for aligned access
- Efficient stride handling for transpose patterns
- Optimal memory coalescing

Performance targets:
- Memory bandwidth: >90% of theoretical peak
- Low latency for small matrices
- Scalability: efficient for matrices 32x32 to 16Kx16K
