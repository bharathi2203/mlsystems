"""
Triton Partial Sum (Tree Reduction) Kernel

Performs efficient parallel reduction using tree-based algorithm
Computes sum of array elements using hierarchical reduction pattern

Triton-specific optimizations:
- Block-level tiling with optimal block sizes
- Automatic vectorization for memory loads
- Efficient reduction primitives (tl.sum, tl.reduce)
- Multi-stage reduction for large arrays

Performance targets:
- Memory bandwidth: >80% of theoretical peak  
- Reduction efficiency: log(n) complexity
- Scalability: efficient for arrays 1K to 1B elements

    1. Load block of data with proper masking
    2. Perform block-level reduction using tl.sum()

    4. Handle edge cases for non-power-of-2 sizes
    
    Key Triton features to use:
    - tl.program_id() for block indexing
    - tl.load() with masking for safe access
    - tl.sum() for efficient block reduction
    - tl.store() for writing partial results
