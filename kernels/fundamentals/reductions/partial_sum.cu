/*
 * Partial Sum Reduction Kernel
 * 
 * Implements tree-based parallel reduction to compute partial sums of an array.
 * Uses shared memory and minimizes warp divergence for optimal performance.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - Tree-based reduction pattern
 * - Shared memory optimization
 * - Warp divergence minimization
 * - Bank conflict avoidance
 * 
 * Based on: PMPP Chapter 8 - Parallel Patterns for Prefix Sum
 * Performance target: ~800 GFLOPS on RTX 4090
