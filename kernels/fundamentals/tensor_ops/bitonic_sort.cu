/*
 * Bitonic Sort Kernel
 * 
 * GPU-optimized sorting algorithm that works well with parallel architectures.
 * Particularly efficient for small-to-medium array sizes that fit in shared memory.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - Bitonic sequence properties
 * - Compare-and-swap operations
 * - Shared memory optimization
 * - Power-of-2 sequence lengths
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Build bitonic sequences of increasing sizes
 * 2. Sort bitonic sequences into monotonic sequences  
 * 3. Merge sorted sequences
 * 4. Repeat until entire array is sorted
 * 
 * Performance: O(logÂ²n) complexity, highly parallel
 * Best for: Sorting small-medium arrays (up to ~32K elements)
