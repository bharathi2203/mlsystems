Triton Dot Product Kernel

Computes the dot product of two vectors: result = sum(a[i] * b[i])

Triton-specific optimizations:
- Block-level tiling for memory coalescing
- Automatic vectorization and loop unrolling
- Register blocking for arithmetic intensity
- Efficient reduction across thread blocks

Performance targets:
- Memory bandwidth: >90% of theoretical peak
- Arithmetic intensity: maximize vectorized operations
- Scalability: efficient for vectors 1K to 100M elements

    Implementation steps:
    1. Load blocks of data with proper masking
    2. Compute element-wise multiplication
    3. Perform block-level reduction
    4. Atomic accumulation to global result
    
    Key Triton features to use:
    - tl.load() with masking for safe memory access
    - tl.sum() for efficient block reduction
    - tl.atomic_add() for global accumulation
