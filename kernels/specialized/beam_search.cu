/*
 * Beam Search Decoding
 * 
 * GPU-accelerated beam search for sequence generation in language models.
 * Efficiently explores multiple hypotheses in parallel for better text generation.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - Parallel hypothesis exploration
 * - Top-k selection at each step
 * - Sequence scoring and ranking
 * - Memory-efficient beam management
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize beams with start token
 * 2. For each generation step:
 *    - Expand all beams with vocabulary
 *    - Score new sequences (log probabilities)
 *    - Select top-k sequences across all beams
 *    - Update beam states
 * 3. Return best complete sequences
 * 
 * Optimization techniques:
 * - Parallel vocabulary expansion
 * - Efficient top-k selection
 * - Memory reuse for beam states
 * - Early stopping for complete sequences
 * 
 * Applications:
 * - Text generation (GPT, T5)
 * - Machine translation
 * - Summarization
 * - Code generation
 * 
 * Performance considerations:
 * - Memory bandwidth for large vocabularies
 * - Top-k selection efficiency
 * - Load balancing across beams
 * - Handling variable sequence lengths
