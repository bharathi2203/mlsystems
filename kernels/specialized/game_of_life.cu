/*
 * Conway's Game of Life Simulation
 * 
 * Cellular automaton simulation demonstrating parallel computation patterns.
 * Excellent example of stencil computations and boundary handling.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - 2D stencil computation
 * - Boundary condition handling
 * - Shared memory optimization
 * - Synchronization patterns
 * 
 * Rules:
 * 1. Live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
 * 2. Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
 * 3. All other cells die or remain dead
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Count live neighbors for each cell
 * 2. Apply rules to determine next state
 * 3. Update grid (double buffering)
 * 4. Repeat for multiple generations
 * 
 * Optimization techniques:
 * - Shared memory for neighbor counting
 * - Halo cell handling for boundaries
 * - Memory coalescing
 * - Thread block organization
 * 
 * Applications beyond simulation:
 * - Stencil computation patterns
 * - Image processing kernels
 * - PDE solvers
