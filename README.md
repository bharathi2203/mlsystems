Stuff I learned, stuff I'm learning, and stuff I want to learn.

## Repository Structure

### [`kernels/`](./kernels/) - GPU Kernel Implementations
GPU kernels organized (roughly) by functionality:
- **fundamentals/**: Core patterns (reductions, memory operations, quantization)
- **linear_algebra/**: Matrix operations, GEMM variants
- **convolutions/**: 1D/2D/3D convolution implementations
- **ml_primitives/**: Activations, attention, normalization, optimizers, loss functions
- **algorithms/**: Sorting, clustering, optimization algorithms
- **specialized/**: Flash Attention, sparse matrices, advanced techniques

### [`platforms/`](./platforms/) - Build Systems & Utilities

### [`projects/`](./projects/) 
- **ray_tracer/**: Multi-platform ray tracing engine

### [`training/`](./training/) - Distributed Training & Optimization
Advanced training techniques and optimization strategies:
- **distributed/**: Multi-GPU and multi-node training
- **optimization/**: Knowledge distillation, quantization
- **profiling/**: Performance analysis and GPU utilization

### [`reading/`](./reading/) - Things I've read 
Summaries and notes from various learning materials:
